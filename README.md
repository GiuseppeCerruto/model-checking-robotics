# Model Checking of Warehouse Robotics 

### Formal Methods for Concurrent and Real-Time Systems A.Y. 2020/2021<br/>
Abstract:
**Automated warehouses** are growing increasingly popular in industrial and
large-scale retail settings. <br/>
Such facilities employ large fleets of custom-tailored **mobile robots** (most
notably, the [Amazon Kiva](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULswQgd73Tc)) to dispatch goods to their destination on the shop floor. These devices can **synchronize** with each other and inspect the
environment to avoid collisions while carrying large storage pods.<br/>
**Human operators** are still involved in residual **manual** tasks at the edge of the
system, such as collecting or stowing products from and in the pods.<br/>
The goal of the project is to exploit formal verification techniques, **specifically
model checking** to:
- **model** the core entities of an automated warehouse 
- **verify** critical properties concerning traffic management and efficiency
